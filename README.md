# Simple Mario Kart Clone

This repository contains a small top-down racing game written in Python using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). It is inspired by classics such as Mario Kart but does not include any Nintendo assets.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) (`pip install pygame`)

## Running the Game

```bash
python3 mariokart.py
```

Use **WASD** to drive the car around the track. Close the window to exit the game.

If an `engine.wav` file is present in this directory and audio output is available, it will play while accelerating.
