This repository includes a simple Flappy Bird clone implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Running the game

1. Install the Pygame dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
2. Run the game with Python:
   ```bash
   python flappy.py
   ```

Press the space bar to flap the bird and avoid the green pipes. The score increases each time you successfully pass a pipe.

## Running in the terminal

If your environment does not support opening a Pygame window, you can play an ASCII version instead:

```bash
python flappy_terminal.py
```

Use the space bar to flap and press `q` to quit.
